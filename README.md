## Overview of the Thesis

This study aims to rapidly produce an algebraic pattern recognition educational game with the focus on teaching low-order and high-order learning outcomes to see if it is able to bridge the current learning gap of students. Findings show that although the game did not yield significant improvements in post-test scores, it successfully fostered strong student engagement. Based on these results, future GBLEs could explore integrating socially collaborative mechanics, clearer mechanics and objectives, more action-oriented mechanics, prerequisite reinforcement, and longer and repeating playtest sessions to determine if these factors enhance learning effectiveness. 


## Overview of the Game

Fix-a-Bots is a 2D puzzle game that presents two minigames with each targeting the lower and higher learning outcomes. The minigame that targets the lower order minigame is named "Van's Workshop" and the minigame that targets the higher order learning outcomes is called "Sequence to Victory".

The minigame named "Van's Workshop" targets the lower order learning outcomes of pattern recognition by finding the missing terms in the sequence, where patterns may range from increasing, to decreasing, to quadratic sequences. The general gameplay loop involves the player accepting an order, and visiting each workstation indicated in an order to complete it. There are 3 workstations in the workshop: the tool station, the sticker station, and the wire station. Each workstation has their own mechanics, and can be thought of as mini-games. The tool station prominently features skip-counting, and numerical pattern recognition involving simple arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction. The sticker station requires the player to count each sticker featured on a sequence of 5 tiles, and it's up to the player to complete the missing tile. Lastly, the wire station presents the player with a sequence of wires whose values are made up of color-coded segments. The player has to determine how many segments are needed, and color these segments appropriately to complete the intended final value of the presented sequence. By finishing tasks on the workstation, the complexity of these stations grow. 

The minigame, "Sequence to Victory", targets the higher order learning outcomes of being able to create formulas that corresponds to the given sequence. The features a rhythm game, where the players have to swipe the screen in perfect timing on a given number period based on the provided numbers in the sequence, to be able to form the number line. Once the number line is formed, players are then tasked to create a formula that satisfies the sequence that was created. They are provided with puzzle pieces  to connect the correct values and symbols in order to generate the correct formula.
